## Features and Functionality

### Carbon Points

- Carbon Points are a loyalty reward point system based upon the carbon friendliness of the supplier.
- When a user buys a particular product, they gain carbon points equivalent to the carbon rating of the seller.
- The carbon rating of the seller is being calculated by Amazon.CO2 Visualizer
